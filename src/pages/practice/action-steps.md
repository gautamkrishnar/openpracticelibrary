  Commitment to action


  This is a collaborative practice building on the [T2R2](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/t2r2-talk-type-read-review/) meeting method.  Action steps asks everyone to commit to taking a first step towards action.  


  Inspired by the idea that 1000 mile journey begins with one step, action steps gets people to think about the first step they will take to continue the work begun together today. Informed by De Bono's Action shoes.
whyDo: >-
  Meetings can sometimes feel like they're all talk, and no action.  


  This is a quick and easy practice to get people to think about what they will do next, and put words into action. 


  It's also a great way to finish a workshop.
howTo: >-
  Talk: Ask everyone to reflect on the work that's been done, and how they might
  continue that work beyond the meeting.


  Type: Get everyone to type down (or write) 


  * Who - Name

  * What - Action to take

  * When - Time and Date it will be done.

  * With -  Help from someone to get it done, review it, or celebrate it!


  Read: Get each person to read their card out loud, and request help from someone in the room


  Review: Use [Affinity Mapping](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/affinity-mapping/) to cluster and summarise action steps, or if there's a lot of actions to take, perhaps vote to prioritise what the group sees as most important to start with.
